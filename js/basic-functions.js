function outputSimpleMsg()
{
	console.log("hello world");
}

//Q1. Write a line of code that will call the function outputSimpleMsg.

//Q2. Change outputMsg so that it accepts a single argument, a string. The function should display 'You entered xxxx' where xxxx is the value of the argument. e.g if called with an argument of 'hello', it should display 'You entered hello' in the console. 

//Q3. Write a function named addTwoNumbers. The function should accept two arguments, both numbers.The total of these numbers should be displayed in the console. e.g. if called with arguments of 10 and 1, it should display 11 in the console. 

//Q4. Write a function named outputPositiveNumbers. The function should accept a single argument, an array of numbers. Only the positive numbers in the array should be displayed in the console, one console message for each positive number in the array.

//Q5. Look at the following code. This code creates a student object and then calls a function named printPassed. Uncomment the code and write the printPassed function. The function should output whether or not the student has passed the module i.e. if they have a mark greater than 40.

// var student={
// 	name:"Jane",
// 	course:"BACB",
// 	mark:60
// }

// printPassed(student)

//Q6. Write a function named simpleLogin. The function should accept two arguments, a username and a password. If the username equals 'user' and the password equals 'letmein' the function should return a value of true. If the correct values aren't used the function should return false. Uncomment the following lines to test your function. 

//console.log(simpleLogin("user","letmein")); //should output true
//console.log(simpleLogin("user","password")); //should output false

//Q7. Write a function addTen. The function should accept a single argument, a number. The function should return the number plus 10 e.g. if called with an argument of 5, the function should return 15. Uncomment the following line to test your function. 

//console.log(addTen(13)); //should output 23

//Q8. Write a function addNumbers. The function should accept a single argument, an array of numbers. The function should return the total of all the numbers in the array e.g. if called with an argument of [3,2,1] the function should return 6. Uncomment the following line to test your function. 

//console.log(addNumbers([3,2,1])); //should output 6

//Q9. Write a function getPositiveNumbers. The function should accept a single argument, an array of numbers. The function should return only those numbers that are positive numbers. The function will need to return an array. Uncomment the following line to test your function. 

//console.log(getPositiveNumbers([-3,12,-11,423,1])); //should output [12,423,1]
